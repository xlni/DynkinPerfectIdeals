# DynkinPerfectIdeals

This Macaulay2 package produces (conjecturally) generic examples of resolutions of perfect ideals, for formats associated to Dynkin diagrams.
See for instance section 4 of Jerzy Weyman's notes https://icerm.brown.edu/topical_workshops/tw-20-frrt/2020icermbasics-revised-last.pdf 

Documentation is not yet written, but will be eventually. For now there is a demo file illustrating the primary uses of this package, including generating examples.
